    "# Intensity Analysis Capstone Project\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Overview\n",
    "This project involves analyzing emotional intensity in content (textual data) to classify it into categories such as happiness, angriness, and sadness using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in the text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and process data, the system will predict the intensity where its happiness, angriness or sadness. This predictive capability will enable to proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.The steps include text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset Attributes\n",
    "The dataset consists of three CSV files representing different emotional intensities (happiness, angriness, sadness). Each file contains two main attributes:\n",
    "- content : Textual content representing user input.\n",
    "- intensity : The associated emotional intensity (label).\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains **2039 rows** of content, with the following unique labels:\n",
    "- Happiness\n",
    "- Angriness\n",
    "- Sadness\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preprocessing\n",
    "To prepare the dataset for model training, several preprocessing steps were performed:\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.\n",
    "2. **Removing Special Characters**: Stripping out any unwanted characters such as HTML tags and punctuation.\n",
    "3. **Stop Words Removal**: Filtering out common words like 'and', 'the', etc.\n",
    "4. **Stemming and Lemmatization**: Reducing words to their base or root form.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\n",
    "- **Unique Value Counts**:\n",
    "  - `intensity`: Count of different intensity labels in the dataset.\n",
    "  - `content`: Count of unique textual entries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feature Engineering\n",
    "Several features were engineered to enhance the model's performance:\n",
    "1. **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: Created from the preprocessed text to capture the relevance of words in the content.\n",
    "2. **N-grams**: Combined unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to capture more context in the text.\n",
    "3. **POS (Part-of-Speech) Tagging**: Extracted grammatical information to enrich features.\n",
    "4. **Sentiment Scores**: Used polarity and subjectivity from the `TextBlob` library to analyze the emotional tone of each entry.\n",
    "5. **Lexical Features**: Additional features, such as the number of exclamations, all-caps words, and smileys, were added to capture intensity-related information.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Preparation for Modeling\n",
    "The processed text was converted into numerical sequences using a tokenizer, and all sentences were padded to a length of 100 tokens for uniformity. Features were combined into a dense matrix for model training.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning\n",
    "- **Model**: Logistic Regression was selected as the baseline model for classification.\n",
    "- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: GridSearchCV was used to find the best parameters, including regularization strength and solver types.\n",
    "- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report were used to evaluate the model’s performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Results\n",
    "X_train shape: (1631, 6860), y_train shape: (1631,)\n",
    "\n",
    "X_test shape: (408, 6860), y_test shape: (408,)\n",
    "\n",
    "Best parameters found:  {'C': 1, 'penalty': 'l2', 'solver': 'liblinear'}\n",
    "\n",
    "Best cross-validation accuracy:  0.7725258437927993\n",
    "\n",
    "Mapped predicted labels: ['angriness' 'happiness' 'sadness']\n",
    "\n",
    "Test Accuracy: 0.8112745098039216\n",
    "\n",
    "## Confusion Matrix\n",
    "The confusion matrix for model evaluation highlights the predicted versus actual classification of emotional intensities.\n",
    "\n",
