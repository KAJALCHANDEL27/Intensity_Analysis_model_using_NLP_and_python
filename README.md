# Intensity Analysis Capstone Project

# Project Overview
This project involves analyzing emotional intensity in content (textual data) to classify it into categories such as happiness, angriness, and sadness using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning. The objective of this project is to develop an intelligent system using NLP to predict the intensity in the text reviews. By analyzing various parameters and process data, the system will predict the intensity where its happiness, angriness or sadness. This predictive capability will enable to proactively optimize their processes, and improve overall customer satisfaction.The steps include text preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning.

Dataset Attributes
The dataset consists of three CSV files representing different emotional intensities (happiness, angriness, sadness). Each file contains two main attributes:

content : Textual content representing user input.
intensity : The associated emotional intensity (label).
The dataset contains 2039 rows of content, with the following unique labels:

Happiness
Angriness
Sadness
Data Preprocessing
To prepare the dataset for model training, several preprocessing steps were performed:

Tokenization: Breaking down text into individual words or tokens.
Removing Special Characters: Stripping out any unwanted characters such as HTML tags and punctuation.
Stop Words Removal: Filtering out common words like 'and', 'the', etc.
Stemming and Lemmatization: Reducing words to their base or root form.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Unique Value Counts:
intensity: Count of different intensity labels in the dataset.
content: Count of unique textual entries.
Feature Engineering
Several features were engineered to enhance the model's performance:

TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency): Created from the preprocessed text to capture the relevance of words in the content.
N-grams: Combined unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams to capture more context in the text.
POS (Part-of-Speech) Tagging: Extracted grammatical information to enrich features.
Sentiment Scores: Used polarity and subjectivity from the TextBlob library to analyze the emotional tone of each entry.
Lexical Features: Additional features, such as the number of exclamations, all-caps words, and smileys, were added to capture intensity-related information.
Data Preparation for Modeling
The processed text was converted into numerical sequences using a tokenizer, and all sentences were padded to a length of 100 tokens for uniformity. Features were combined into a dense matrix for model training.

Model Training & Hyperparameter Tuning
Model: Logistic Regression was selected as the baseline model for classification.
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearchCV was used to find the best parameters, including regularization strength and solver types.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report were used to evaluate the model’s performance.

Conclusion and Future Work
This project successfully built a predictive model for emotional intensity classification using NLP techniques. Future work may include: • Exploring advanced models (e.g., deep learning architectures). • Incorporating more diverse datasets for improved generalization. • Investigating transfer learning techniques using pre-trained language models (e.g., BERT). Here’s a detailed discussion on the benefits of your intensity analysis project to both stakeholders and potential users:

Benefits to Stakeholders
Enhanced Customer Insights:

Stakeholders can gain a deeper understanding of customer sentiments and emotional responses through data-driven analysis. This can help in tailoring products, services, and marketing strategies to meet customer needs more effectively.
Improved Decision Making:

The insights generated from emotional intensity analysis can aid stakeholders in making informed decisions, such as targeting specific customer segments or addressing negative sentiments promptly.
Competitive Advantage:

By leveraging advanced NLP techniques, stakeholders can differentiate their offerings from competitors who may not utilize sentiment analysis, leading to a stronger market position.
Optimized Marketing Strategies:

Understanding emotional responses can guide stakeholders in designing targeted marketing campaigns that resonate with their audience, improving engagement and conversion rates.
Resource Allocation:

Stakeholders can allocate resources more effectively by focusing on areas that generate positive emotional responses, leading to better ROI on marketing and product development initiatives.
Risk Management:

Identifying negative sentiments early can help stakeholders mitigate risks related to customer dissatisfaction and potential backlash, allowing for proactive measures to be implemented.
Benefits to Potential Users
Personalized Experience:

Users can benefit from more personalized interactions with brands, as emotional intensity analysis allows companies to tailor their services and recommendations based on user sentiment.
Informed Choices:

By understanding the emotional tones of products or services through reviews and feedback, users can make more informed choices that align with their preferences.
Feedback Mechanism:

Users can express their sentiments, knowing that their emotional responses are being analyzed and considered, fostering a sense of engagement and connection with the brand.
Enhanced Communication:

Companies using emotional intensity analysis can improve their communication strategies with users, ensuring messages resonate emotionally and are relevant to user needs.
Support for Mental Health:

The analysis can be beneficial in platforms focusing on mental health, as understanding emotional intensity can help identify users who may need support, leading to timely interventions.
Community Building:

Users can feel part of a community that values their opinions and emotions, enhancing brand loyalty and encouraging users to share their experiences.
Content Relevance:

Users can receive more relevant content (e.g., articles, advertisements) that align with their emotional states, improving overall user experience and satisfaction.
Empowerment through Expression:

The ability to express emotions and have them recognized can empower users, contributing to their sense of validation and community.
This structure not only highlights the benefits for each group but also emphasizes how they can work synergistically to create a more engaging and responsive ecosystem for emotional intensity analysis.
