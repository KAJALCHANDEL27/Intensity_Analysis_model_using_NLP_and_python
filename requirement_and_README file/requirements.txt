Here’s a list of the necessary libraries and packages you need to import and install to ensure the code runs smoothly. You may want to install them using pip or conda based on your environment.

Python Libraries and Packages:

pandas – For handling dataframes and CSV files.
numpy – For numerical computations.
matplotlib – For plotting and visualizations.
seaborn – For enhanced data visualizations, such as confusion matrix heatmaps.
re – For regular expressions (used in text preprocessing).
nltk – For natural language processing tasks like tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
scikit-learn – For machine learning algorithms and tools like LogisticRegression, GridSearchCV, and LabelEncoder.
textblob – For sentiment analysis (polarity and subjectivity scores).
tensorflow – For padding and working with text sequences.
scipy – For combining sparse matrices.
pickle – For model serialization.
warnings – To suppress unwanted warnings in the output.

Libraries and Their Corresponding Pip Install Commands:
# Install pandas for data manipulation
pip install pandas

# Install numpy for numerical operations
pip install numpy

# Install matplotlib for plotting
pip install matplotlib

# Install seaborn for advanced visualizations
pip install seaborn

# Install nltk for natural language processing

Additional Setup (for NLTK):
Make sure to download the required corpora for NLTK, such as stopwords and wordnet.

import nltk
nltk.download('stopwords')
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('wordnet')
nltk.download('averaged_perceptron_tagger')  # For POS tagging
